    <p id="text">Diwali is my favorite festival. On this day Lord Ram returned to Ayodhya after killing Ravana. 
    It is a festival of light.<br> People decorate their houses. Shopkeepers start new ledger from this day.
    Goddess Lakshmi is worshipped in the evening. <br> People distribute sweets and gifts among friends and relatives.<br>
    There is a practice of exploding crackers at night which is not good for health and the environment.<br> 
    We must avoid crackers. I enjoy Diwali very much.
