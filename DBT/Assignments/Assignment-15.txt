1) Assume there is a table called Multicust, with all of the same column definitions as Salespeople. Write a command that inserts all salespeople with more than one customer into this table.

mysql> INSERT INTO Multicust (Snum, Sname, City, Comm)
    -> SELECT s.Snum, s.Sname, s.City, s.Comm
    -> FROM salespeople s
    -> WHERE s.Snum IN (
    ->     SELECT Snum
    ->     FROM customers
    ->     GROUP BY Snum
    ->     HAVING COUNT(Cnum) > 1
    -> );
ERROR 1146 (42S02): Table 'cdacmumbai.multicust' doesn't exist

2) Write a command that deletes all customers with no current orders.

mysql> DELETE FROM customers
    -> WHERE Cnum NOT IN (
    ->     SELECT Cnum
    ->     FROM orders
    -> );
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.08 sec)

3) Write a command that increases by twenty percent the commissions of all salespeople with total orders above Rs. 3,000.

mysql> UPDATE salespeople
    -> SET Comm = Comm * 1.20
    -> WHERE Snum IN (
    ->     SELECT Snum
    ->     FROM orders
    ->     GROUP BY Snum
    ->     HAVING SUM(Amt) > 3000
    -> );
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.10 sec)
